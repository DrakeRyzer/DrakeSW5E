## Appendage Droid Parts

### Siege Arms
*Droid Customization (part), <font style="color:gray">standard</font>, minor*

You modify your arms to create greater impacts and to be more effective against barriers. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 kinetic damage and deal double damage against objects and structures.

#### Weapon integration
_**Droid customization** (part), <font style="color:#4a5568">**standard**</font>_<br>
You can now integrate a single weapon that weighs no more than 8 lb. into your droid chassis. Over the course of a short or long rest, you can insert and integrate this weapon into your frame. While integrated, that weapon gains the hidden and fixed properties.


## Defensive Droid Parts

### Droid Capacitor Plating
*Droid customization (part), <font style="color:red">artifact</font>, major*
<br>*Prerequisite: Proficiency with heavy armor*

While you have no armor integrated, your AC becomes 21 (your Dexterity modifier does not affect this number) and you count as wearing heavy armor. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

Addtionally, you have resistance to energy, ion, and lightning damage from enhanced sources. 

- **Charges:** This armor has a maximum of 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges after a long rest. While wearing and attuned to them, you can use a reaction to expend 1 or more of its charges to activate the *Absorb Energy* tech power. For each additional charge expended, activate the power at a higher power level, to a maximum of 9th level.

*Based on an inverse architecture of Energized Armor, Capacitor Armor actually absorbs incoming energy and converts it into useable power for the droid's internal power source. The rest of the energy is dissipated harmlessly into the environment around the droid.*
