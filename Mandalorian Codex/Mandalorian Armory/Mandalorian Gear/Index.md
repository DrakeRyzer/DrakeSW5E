### Mandalorian Crushgaunts
*Clothing (gloves), <font style="color:fuchsia">advanced</font>, [Mandalorian Vestments](https://drakeryzer.github.io/DrakeSW5E/Mandalorian%20Codex/Mandalorian%20Equipment/Index.html#mandalorian-vestments)*
<br> *Requires Attunement*

*Crushgaunts, also called shuk'orok in Mando'a, were a type of strength-enhancing gauntlets created by the Mandalorians that could increase their wearer's grip strength to the point that they could shatter bones, crush durasteel, and deflect weapons, even lightsaber blades.*

While wearing these gloves you gain the following benefits:
- Your damage die for your unarmed strikes increases by two steps (from 1 to d6, d4 to d8, d6 to d10, or d8 to d12). Additionally they deal double damage against structures and count as enhanced.
- You have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks involving use of your hands and gain the [*Barbed*](https://sw5e.com/rules/wh/equipment#barbed) (1d4) property.
- When you are hit by a melee weapon attack, you can use your reaction to attempt to deflect it. You gain a +2 bonus to AC against the triggering attack.

### Mandalorian Manacles
*Adventuring Gear [(binders)](https://sw5e.com/loot/adventuringGear/?search=Binders), <font style="color:lime">premium</font>*

*A type of binders that used beskar iron in their construction.*

Escaping the binders requires a successful DC 30 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 30 Strength check. Each set of binders comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with security kit can pick the binders’ lock with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check. Binders have 40 hit points.

### Repulsor Gauntlet
*Adventuring Gear (forearm), <font style="color:gray">standard</font>*

*Weaponized repulser technology that creates shockwaves capable of repelling enemies*

The gauntlet has 5 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action it on a creature within melee range or reaction, which you can take when you are hit by a melee attack, to expend 1 of its charges to activate it. A creature must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 kinetic damage and if the creature is Medium or smaller, it is pushed up to 10 feet away from you.

The gauntlet regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges after a long rest.
