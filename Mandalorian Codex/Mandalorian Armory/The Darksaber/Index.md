*"Anyone can hold the Darksaber. The trick is keeping it, along with your head."* <br>
―Ursa Wren to Sabine Wren

The Darksaber was an ancient and unique black-bladed lightsaber created by Tarre Vizsla, the first Mandalorian ever inducted into the Jedi Order, prior to 1019 BBY. The weapon was kept in the Jedi Temple after Vizsla's passing, but members of House Vizsla stole the saber in a conflict with the Jedi during the fall of the Old Republic. The Darksaber was passed down, generation to generation, by the ancestors of Pre Vizsla, who held onto the weapon even after the pacifist ideals of the New Mandalorians replaced the warrior ways of Mandalore.

The Darksaber was an ancient black-bladed lightsaber. It had a unique blade that was shorter than that of most lightsabers, and shaped like a traditional sword. Its overall profile was distinctly Mandalorian with an angular pommel, hand guard, and slit-shaped blade emitter. The sound emitted by its blade was also higher pitched than other lightsabers. 

The Darksaber had a crystal which served as a conduit for Force energy. The wielder's thoughts and actions guided the blade's current of power, with the blade often producing an electrical effect in response to a heightened emotional state. The Darksaber was also capable of parrying lightsaber blades, with them being drawn to each other in an almost magnetic pull. It was respected by the Mandalorians as a symbol for the leadership of House Vizsla, and later Death Watch. 

According to Mandalorian custom, one could only obtain the Darksaber by defeating the previous owner in combat. Should they have claimed it any other way, their claim was considered illegitimate.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this Enhanced weapon. Additionally, the weapon gains the finesse property and ignores resistance to energy damage.

When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature’s heads. The creature dies if it can’t survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to energy damage, doesn’t have or need a head, has legendary actions or villain status, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d6 energy damage from the hit.

#### Attunement Condition
The Darksaber is traditionally in the possession of a Mandalorian warrior and is treasured amongst the many clans of Mandalore. To truly be a wielder of this artifact, one must follow the customs of these battle hardened people. 

This is done by challenging the current wielder to a duel, often times to the death. Other than there being no interference, there is no other rules either combatant must contend themselves to, though this depends on the warrior. If successful in beating the current wielder of the Darksaber, the recipient of the blade is considered its rightful owner.

Should the blade be claimed in any way that they shall not be recognized as the Manda'lor, the user may attune to it but they cannot use the *Symbol of The Manda'lor* feature, and the charges granted by the blade, as well risk being challenged by Mandalorian warriors who seek to reclaim their stolen heritage.
