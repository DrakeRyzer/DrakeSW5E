# Ballistic Approach

<img src='../../../../Images/Classes/' style='float:right; width:300px;'>

For many, rushing an opponent with guns blazing is a last resort. For Berserkers of the Ballistic Approach, this isn't a last resort; it's the primary plan. Leading up a melee charge with a blaster and pure unbridled rage, the berserker never lets an empty gun diminish their fury.

## Firestorm
***Ballistic Approach:** 3rd level* <br>
You gain proficiency in martial blasters with the burst or rapid property. Additionally, you've learned to use ranged weapons with untold fury. While wielding a blaster with which you are proficient, you gain the following benefits:

- You can use your choice of Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls of blaster weapons against targets within 30 feet of you. You must use the same modifier for both rolls. **Additionally, at 9th level this range increases to within 60 feet of you and at 14th level this increases to within 90 feet of you.**
- When you use a blaster as an improvised weapon, you are considered proficient with it.
- **When affected by your Reckless Attack feature, you additionally cause creatures affected by a saving throw against the burst or rapid property of a weapon you control to have disadvantage against the saving throw.**

## Explosive
***Ballistic Approach:** 3rd and 9th level* <br>
While raging, you gain the following benefits:
- **When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack made with a blaster weapon, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.**
- You add your rage damage to damage rolls from ranged weapon attacks using Strength. 
- At 9th level, when a creature rolls a 1 on a saving throw against your burst or rapid property, you can add your Brutal Critical dice to the damage.

## Rampage
***Ballistic Approach:** 6th level* <br>
While raging, when you deal damage with a blaster with which you are proficient, and you added your Strength modifier to the damage roll, you can use a bonus action to move up to half your speed towards your target. You must end this movement closer to your target than you started. If you end this movement within 5 feet of your target, you can make one melee weapon attack with your blaster as a part of this bonus action.

## Down, Not Out
***Ballistic Approach:** 10th level* <br>
When you are hit with an attack by a creature within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a single attack against that creature with a blaster with which you are proficient.

## Brawn
***Ballistic Approach:** 14th level* <br>
When you use the burst property of a blaster with which are you proficient, you can apply your rage damage bonus to every target that takes damage, instead of just one. Additionally, when a Large or smaller creature fails the saving throw against your burst or rapid property while within 30 feet of you, it is knocked prone.
