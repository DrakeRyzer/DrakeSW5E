# Stealth
When a creature tries to hide, it relies on its Dexterity to remain unnoticed. A creature can attempt a Dexterity check to sneak around, moving quietly and using cover and heavily obscured areas to avoid detection.

There are two ways you can hide. If a creature can’t possibly see you, you need only to avoid making noise to avoid detection. If a creature might see you, you need to keep behind cover or stay in heavily obscured areas to remain hidden.

When you try to hide from one or more creatures, your Dexterity check is contested by the Wisdom check of any creature who might notice you or the Intelligence check of a creature that is actively searching for signs of your presence. You make one Dexterity check for this contest. Use that check result for all such contests you engage in until you are discovered or you stop hiding.

## Conditions for Stealth
In order to avoid detection, you need some way to remain out of sight, either something to hide behind or an area of poor visibility to locate  yourself in.

- **Stay out of sight.** You can’t just stand in the middle of an empty, lit room and hope to avoid notice. Something must conceal you, perhaps a large object, a piece of terrain, or an immobile creature of a sufficient size, such as a slumbering dragon. Regardless of what stands between you and a viewer, it must cover at least half your body for you to hide behind it. An environmental phenomenon that obscures you from view can also provide a means to hide.
- A **heavily obscured** area typically contains darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage. A creature in a heavily obscured area is out of sight, just as it if were hiding behind an obstruction, and thus can try to hide. A lightly obscured area typically contains dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage. Some monsters and characters have special abilities that enable them to try to hide even in areas that are only lightly obscured. 
- **Stay quiet.** It’s assumed that you try to avoid making noise while hiding, and your Dexterity check also represents your ability to keep quiet. If you make a noise, such as yelling a warning to an ally or knocking over a vase, you give away your position and are thus no longer hidden. 

## Benefit of Being Hidden 
You have advantage on the attack roll when you attack a creature from which you are hidden. Making an attack reveals your position, however.
